# AI Resume Analyzer

A tool that reads resumes and job descriptions, then scores and ranks resumes based on how well they match the job.

## What You Need

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (comes with Python)

## Setup Steps

1. Download or clone this project to your computer

2. Open a command prompt or terminal in the project folder

3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Download NLTK data (needed for text processing):
   ```
   python -m nltk.downloader punkt stopwords averaged_perceptron_tagger
   ```

## How to Run

1. Open command prompt or terminal in the project folder

2. Run the app:
   ```
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

3. A web page will open automatically in your browser. If not, open:
   ```
   http://localhost:8501
   ```

4. Use the web page to:
   - Upload resumes (PDF or text files)
   - Paste a job description
   - Click "Analyze" to see matching scores
   - Download results as CSV

## How It Works

The app does this in order:
1. Reads the resume files
2. Cleans and extracts text
3. Finds skills and information using built-in ATS
4. Compares with the job description
5. Scores each resume
6. Ranks them from best to worst match

## Troubleshooting

**Error: "Module not found"**
- Make sure you ran `pip install -r requirements.txt`

**Error: "port 8501 is in use"**
- The app will try a different port automatically

**Slow on first run**
- First time takes longer because it downloads AI models. This is normal.
